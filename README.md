The task of implementing an image color detector involves identifying the dominant colors present in an input image or video. 
This can be achieved using various techniques such as clustering algorithms like K-Means, where the colors in the image are grouped into clusters based on their similarities. 
The colors can then be extracted from the centroid of each cluster, and their frequency can be plotted in a chart to show the most dominant colors. 
This task is useful in various applications such as image processing, data visualization, and web design.
